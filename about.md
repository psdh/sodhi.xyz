My name is Prabhjyot Singh Sodhi

I'm primarily a Software Developer and a Runner.

On this blog, I post weekly updates on where I am and what I am doing. (I'm not adding any more plans, because: http://www.itssarahrexford.com/blog//casey-neistat-action-and-intent)

I'm really big on personal improvement and growth so if you want to discuss anything, please hit me up on those little icons below!

Apart from my job, I like to spend my time on my podcast (embeded below) and on my [workouts](https://www.strava.com/athletes/22441958).

Here's the latest episode from The Early Twenties podcast:

I am currently located in London and **would love** to meet you if you're around. If you'd too, or if you simply have a question that you think I might be able to help you with, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!

I know it's ugly but it'll get the job done. Will fix it soon! <3
